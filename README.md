# ElectionCat

ElectionCat is a web application made during HackTech 2018. Officer elections are coming up in the coming days for most student-led collegieate organizations, so ElectionCat was made to be a better voting poll than Google Forms.  ElectionCat allows for an admin to open and close voting in this application.
